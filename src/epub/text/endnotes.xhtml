Its root is that of the verb <i>rotisya</i>, to bind oneself by an oath; and it is generally admitted to be only another form of <i>rota</i>, which now signifies a “regimental company.” In both words the underlying idea is that of a body of men united by an oath. <i xml:lang="it">Tribu</i> were possibly gentile groups, united by common descent, and included individuals connected by marriage.
