					<p>“Contrary to fidelity” or “faith,” <i xml:lang="it">contro alla fede</i>, and <i xml:lang="it">tutto fede</i>, “altogether faithful,” in the next paragraph. It is noteworthy that these two phrases, “<span xml:lang="it">contro alla fede</span>” and “<span xml:lang="it">tutto fede</span>,” were omitted in the Testina edition, which was published with the sanction of the papal authorities. It may be that the meaning attached to the word <i xml:lang="it">fede</i> was “the faith,” <abbr>i.e.</abbr> the Catholic creed, and not as rendered here “fidelity” and “faithful.” Observe that the word <i xml:lang="it">religione</i> was suffered to stand in the text of the Testina, being used to signify indifferently every shade of belief, as witness “the religion,” a phrase inevitably employed to designate the Huguenot heresy. <cite>South in his Sermon <span epub:type="z3998:roman">IX</span>, <abbr>p.</abbr> 69, <abbr>ed.</abbr> 1843</cite>, comments on this passage as follows: <q>“That great patron and Coryphaeus of this tribe, Niccolò Machiavel, laid down this for a master rule in his political scheme: ‘That the show of religion was helpful to the politician, but the reality of it hurtful and pernicious.’ ”</q> <a href="chapter-18.xhtml#noteref-40" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>“Guilds or societies,” <i xml:lang="it">in arti o in tribu</i>. <i xml:lang="it">Arti</i> were craft or trade guilds, cf.

Institutions of a somewhat similar character, called <i>artel</i>, exist in Russia today, cf. Sir Mackenzie Wallace’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Russia</i>, <abbr>ed.</abbr> 1905: <q>“The sons … were always during the working season members of an artel.

Its root is that of the verb <i>rotisya</i>, to bind oneself by an oath; and it is generally admitted to be only another form of <i>rota</i>, which now signifies a “regimental company.” In both words the underlying idea is that of a body of men united by an oath. <i xml:lang="it">Tribu</i> were possibly gentile groups, united by common descent, and included individuals connected by marriage.
